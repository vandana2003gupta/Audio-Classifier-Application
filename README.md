# ðŸŽµ Audio Classifier Application

This is my **Audio Classifier Application**, where I explore how machine learning can be applied to understand and classify audio signals.  
---

I built this project to strengthen my skills in audio preprocessing, deep learning, and deployment. Itâ€™s not just a codebase â€” itâ€™s a reflection of my journey in Data Science and AI. 

- Preprocessed audio data into MFCCs and spectrograms  
- Trained ML/DL models for audio classification  
- Wrote scripts for both training and real-time prediction  
- Structured the project to make it easy to extend and deploy  
- Experimented with multiple model architectures
